# Flight Information

This project utilizes the AeroDataBox api from rapidapi.com to provide flight information from the user's local airport to the destination of the user's choice. The program asks the current location of the user to find all nearby available airports. Once the user selects an airport, the program provides the local day, time, and timezone of the airport. Next, the user selects a destination and the program provides all airlines that provide flights to the destination airport. Finally, the distance between the two airports and the time of flight are given.
