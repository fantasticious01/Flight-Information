I am working on getting the names of the airports from the api data.

The api returns a string that looks like a dictionary.
    1. Maybe we can convert string into a dictionary
    2. need to figure out a way to set the regular expression pattern to get the city names

I also need to find a way to print city names that have white space without 20% printing.
    i.e. "grand20%rapids"
